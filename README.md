## Overview

The `github.com/cardrank/cardrank` package contains types for [cards][card], [card
suits][suit], [card ranks][rank], [card decks][deck], and [hands of
cards][hand].

A single [package level type][type] provides a standard interface for dealing
cards for, and evaluating [poker hands][hand] of the following:

<!-- START overview -->
* [Texas Holdem][holdem-example]
* [Texas Holdem Short (6+)][short-example]
* [Texas Holdem Royal (10+)][royal-example]
* [Omaha][omaha-example]
* [Omaha Hi/Lo][omaha-hi-lo-example]
* [Stud][stud-example]
* [Stud Hi/Lo][stud-hi-lo-example]
* [Razz][razz-example]
* [Badugi][badugi-example]
<!-- END -->

[Hand evaluation and ranking][hand-ranking] of the different [poker hand
types][type] is accomplished through pure Go implementations of [well-known
poker rank evaluation algorithms](#cactus-kev). [Poker hands][hand] can be
compared and [ordered to determine the hand's winner(s)][winners].

## Using

To use within a Go package or module:

```sh
go get github.com/cardrank/cardrank
```

See package level [Go documentation][pkg].

### Quickstart

Complete [examples for all `Type`'s][examples] are available, including
additional examples showing use of various types, utilities, and interfaces is
available in the [Go package documentation][pkg].

Below are quick examples for `Holdem` and `OmahaHiLo` included in the
[example](/_example) directory:

##### Texas Holdem

The following showcases a simple game of Texas Holdem:

<!-- START holdem -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"

	"github.com/cardrank/cardrank"
)

func main() {
	const players = 6
	seed := time.Now().UnixNano()
	// note: use a better pseudo-random number generator
	rnd := rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed))
	pockets, board := cardrank.Holdem.Deal(rnd, players)
	hands := cardrank.Holdem.RankHands(pockets, board)
	fmt.Printf("------ Holdem %d ------\n", seed)
	fmt.Printf("Board:    %b\n", board)
	for i := 0; i < players; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("Player %d: %b %s %b %b\n", i+1, hands[i].Pocket, hands[i].Description(), hands[i].HiBest, hands[i].HiUnused)
	}
	h, pivot := cardrank.Order(hands)
	if pivot == 1 {
		fmt.Printf("Result:   Player %d wins with %s %b\n", h[0]+1, hands[h[0]].Description(), hands[h[0]].HiBest)
	} else {
		var s, b []string
		for j := 0; j < pivot; j++ {
			s = append(s, strconv.Itoa(h[j]+1))
			b = append(b, fmt.Sprintf("%b", hands[h[j]].HiBest))
		}
		fmt.Printf("Result:   Players %s push with %s %s\n", strings.Join(s, ", "), hands[h[0]].Description(), strings.Join(b, ", "))
	}
}
```

### Hand Ranking

Poker [`Hand`][hand]'s make use of a [`HandRank`][hand-rank] to determine the
relative rank of a `Hand`, on a low-to-high basis. Higher poker hands
have a lower value `HandRank` than lower poker hands. For example, a
[`StraightFlush`][hand-rank] will have a lower `HandRank` than a
[`FullHouse`][hand-rank].

When a [`Hand`][hand] is created, a Hi and Lo (if applicable) `HandRank` is
evaluated, and made available via [`Hand.HiRank`][hand.hi-rank] and
[`Hand.LoRank`][hand.lo-rank] methods, respectively. The Hi and Lo
`HandRank`'s are evaluated by a `EvalRankFunc`, dependent on the `Hand`'s
[`Type`][type]:

#### Cactus Kev

For regular poker hand types, poker hand rank is determined by Go
implementations of different [Cactus Kev][cactus-kev] evaluators:

* [`Cactus`][cactus] - the original [Cactus Kev][cactus-kev] poker hand evaluator
* [`CactusFast`][cactus-fast] - the [Fast Cactus][senzee] poker hand evaluator, using Paul Senzee's perfect hash lookup
* [`TwoPlusTwo`][two-plus-two] - the [2+2 forum][tangentforks] poker hand evaluator, using a 130 MiB lookup table

See [below for more information](#default-rank-func) on the default rank func in
use by the package, and for information on [using build tags][build-tags] to
enable/disable functionality for different target runtime environments.

#### Default Rank Func

The package-level [`DefaultRank`][default-rank] variable is used for regular
poker evaluation. For most scenarios, the [`Hybrid`][hybrid] rank func provides
the best possible evaluation performance, and is used by default when no [build
tags][build-tags] have been specified.

#### Hybrid

The [`Hybrid`][hybrid] rank func uses either the [`CactusFast`][cactus-fast] or
an instance of the [`TwoPlusTwo`][two-plus-two] depending on the [`Hand`][hand]
having 5, 6, or 7 cards.

#### Two-Plus-Two

The [`TwoPlusTwo`][two-plus-two] makes use of a large (approximately 130 MiB)
lookup table to accomplish extremely fast 5, 6 and 7 card hand rank evaluation.
Due to the large size of the lookup table, the `TwoPlusTwo` will be excluded
when using the using the [`portable` or `embedded` build tags][build-tags].

The `TwoPlusTwo` is disabled by default for `GOOS=js` (ie, WASM) builds, but
can be enabled using the [`forcefat` build tag][build-tags].

### Winner Determination

Winner(s) are determined by the lowest possible [`HandRank`][hand-rank] when
comparing a [`Hand`'s][hand] [`HiRank`][hand.hi-rank] or [`LoRank`][hand.lo-rank]
against another hand's. Two or more hands having a `HandRank` of equal value
indicate that the hands have equivalent ranks, and thus have both won.

Thus, when `Hand`'s are sorted (low-to-high) by `HiRank` or `LoRank`, the
winner(s) of a hand will be the hands in the lowest position and having
equivalent `HiRank`'s or `LoRank`'s.

#### Comparing Hands

A [`Hand`][hand] can be compared to another `Hand` using
[`HiComp`][hand.hi-comp] and [`LoComp`][hand.lo-comp].

`HiComp` and `LowComp` return `-1`, `0`, or `+1`, making it easy to compare
or sort hands:

```go
// Compare hi hands:
if hand1.HiComp()(hand1, hand2) < 0 {
	fmt.Printf("%s is a winner!", hand1)
}

// Compare lo hands:
if hand1.LoComp()(hand1, hand2) == 0 {
	fmt.Printf("%s and %s are equal!", hand1, hand2)
}

// Sort hi hands:
hi := hands[0].HiComp()
sort.Slice(hands, func(i, j int) bool {
	return hi(hands[i], hands[j]) < 0
})

// Sort lo hands:
lo := hands[0].LoComp()
sort.Slice(hands, func(i, j int) bool {
	return lo(hands[i], hands[j]) < 0
})
```

#### Ordering Hands

[`HiOrder`][hi-order] and [`LoOrder`][lo-order] determine the winner(s) of a
hand by ordering the indexes of a [`[]*Hand`][hand] and returning the list of
ordered hands as a `[]int` and an `int` pivot indicating the position within
the returned list demarcating winning and losing hands.

A `Hand` whose index is in position `i < pivot` is considered to be the
winner(s) of the hand. Hi hands are guaranteed to have 1 or more winner(s),
while Lo hands have 0 or more winner(s):

```go
// Order hi hands by lowest hand rank, low to high:
h, pivot := cardrank.Order(hands)
for i := 0; i < pivot; i++ {
	fmt.Printf("%s is a Hi winner!", hands[h[i]])
}

// Order lo hands by lowest hand rank, low to high:
// (applicable only for a hand types that supports lo hands)
l, pivot := cardrank.LowOrder(hands)
for i := 0; i < pivot; i++ {
	fmt.Printf("%s is a Lo winner!", hands[h[i]])
}
```

See [the examples][examples] for an overview of using the package APIs for
winner determination for the different [`Type`][type] of poker hands.

### Build Tags

Build tags can be used with `go build` to change the package's build
configuration. Available tags:

#### `portable`

The `portable` tag disables the `TwoPlusTwo`, in effect excluding the the
[large lookup table](#two-plus-two), and creating significantly smaller
binaries but at the cost of more expensive poker hand rank evaluation. Useful
when building for portable or embedded environments, such as a client
application:

```sh
go build -tags portable
```

#### `embedded`

The `embedded` tag disables the `CactusFast` and the `TwoPlusTwo`, creating the
smallest possible binaries. Useful when either embedding the package in another
application, or in constrained runtime environments such as WASM:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags embedded
```

#### `noinit`

The `noinit` tag disables the package level initialization. Useful when
applications need the fastest possible startup times and can defer
initialization, or when using a third-party algorithm:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags 'embedded noinit' -o cardrank.wasm
```

When using the `noinit` build tag, the user will need to call the [`Init`
func][init] to set `DefaultCactus`, `DefaultRank` and to register the default
types automatically:

```go
// Set DefaultCactus, DefaultRank based on available implementations:
cardrank.Init()
```

Alternatively, the `DefaultCactus` and `DefaultRank` can be set manually. After
`DefaultCactus` and `DefaultRank` have been set, call `RegisterDefaultTypes` to
register built in types:

```go
// Set manually (such as when using a third-party implementation):
cardrank.DefaultCactus = cardrank.Cactus
cardrank.DefaultRank = cardrank.NewHandRank(cardrank.Cactus)

// Then call RegisterDefaultTypes to register default types
if err := cardrank.RegisterDefaultTypes(); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

#### `forcefat`

The `forcefat` tag forces a "fat" binary build, including the `TwoPlusTwo`'s
large lookup table, irrespective of other build tags:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -tags 'forcefat' -o cardrank.wasm
```
